## Jenny Bell

- I am a Makers Academy July 2021 graduate, looking to keep learning and find my place in the tech industry.
- I produced a final project I am very proud of and a solid grasp of Ruby and Javascript, among other tech.
- I am excited to keep learning more about the world of software development, and have found I have a particular interest in DevOps and I can't wait to explore that further, and see where it can take me.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

- Working in operations and management in hospitality, an industry where everything goes wrong all the time and requires out of the box thinking, means that I have developed excellent problem solving ability.
- Staying calm, getting things done without a fuss, building new operational systems from scratch to combat problems no one even considered, and proving myself enough to be promoted in two roles with no experience.

#### People and teamwork

- In all my previous jobs, including in customer service and sales, I have used my people skills to get things done, and form productive relationships.
- At my last job, there was no HR system in place and my skills were recognised enough for me to be put in charge of creating a whole new system of policies and procedures with regards to both people and general company operations.
- This meant the whole comapny ran as a more cohesive team, and led to a 50% reduction in staff turnover.


## Education

#### Makers Academy (April-July 2021)
- I used my persitance, good communication, and ability to work in a team to learn as much as I could, and create production quality codebases in a short amount of time.
- I frequently used pairing in order to problemsolve effeciently.
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine
- I gravitated towards DevOps roles in my project teams 

#### Newcastle University (2009-2012)

- Biomedical Sciences with Business
- 2:1

## Hobbies

- I have played Dungeons and Dragons for many years and have a creative outlet making handmade dice to play with. This improves my communication, lateral thinking and creativity. It has also provided me with many ideas for personal projects that I can't wait to code.
